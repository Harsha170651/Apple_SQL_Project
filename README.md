## Project Overview

This project is designed to showcase advanced SQL querying techniques through the analysis of over 1 million rows of Apple retail sales data. The dataset includes information about products, stores, sales transactions, and warranty claims across various Apple retail locations globally. By tackling a variety of questions, from basic to complex, you'll demonstrate your ability to write sophisticated SQL queries that extract valuable insights from large datasets.

The project is ideal for data analysts looking to enhance their SQL skills by working with a large-scale dataset and solving real-world business questions.

2. **category**: Holds product category information.
   - `category_id`: Unique identifier for each product category.
   - `category_name`: Name of the category.

3. **products**: Details about Apple products.
   - `product_id`: Unique identifier for each product.
   - `product_name`: Name of the product.
   - `category_id`: References the category table.
   - `launch_date`: Date when the product was launched.
   - `price`: Price of the product.

4. **sales**: Stores sales transactions.
   - `sale_id`: Unique identifier for each sale.
   - `sale_date`: Date of the sale.
   - `store_id`: References the store table.
   - `product_id`: References the product table.
   - `quantity`: Number of units sold.

5. **warranty**: Contains information about warranty claims.
   - `claim_id`: Unique identifier for each warranty claim.
   - `claim_date`: Date the claim was made.
   - `sale_id`: References the sales table.
   - `repair_status`: Status of the warranty claim (e.g., Paid Repaired, Warranty Void).

## SQL Questions with Answers:

    YEAR(sale_date) = '2023'
        AND MONTH(sale_date) = '12';
```
4. Determine how many stores have never had a warranty claim filed.
  ``` sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS total_stores
FROM
    stores
WHERE
    store_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT
            store_id
        FROM
            sales AS s
                RIGHT JOIN
            warranty AS w ON w.sale_id = s.sale_id)
```
5. Calculate the percentage of warranty claims marked as "Warranty Void".
  ``` sql
SELECT 
    ROUND(COUNT(claim_id)/ (select count(*) from warranty) *  100, 1) AS warranty_void_percentage
FROM
    warranty
WHERE
    repair_status = 'warranty void'
```
6. Identify which store had the highest total units sold in the last year.
``` sql
SELECT 
    sa.store_id, st.store_name, SUM(sa.quantity) AS total_sales
FROM
    sales AS sa
        JOIN
    stores AS st ON st.store_id = sa.store_id
WHERE
    sale_date >= CURDATE() - INTERVAL 1 YEAR
GROUP BY sa.store_id , st.store_name
ORDER BY SUM(sa.quantity) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
7. Count the number of unique products sold in the last year.
 ``` sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    COUNT(s.product_id) AS total_product, p.product_name
FROM
    sales AS s
        JOIN
    products AS p ON p.product_id = s.product_id
WHERE
    sale_date >= CURDATE() - INTERVAL 1 YEAR
GROUP BY product_name
ORDER BY COUNT(s.product_id) DESC
lIMIT 1;
```
8. Find the average price of products in each category.
